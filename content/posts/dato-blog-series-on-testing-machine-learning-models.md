In a [previous post](tdd-machine-learning.html), I talked about using
TDD for Machine Learning applications. It was a very basic mind-dump and
I am happy that [Dato Blog](http://blog.dato.com/) is running a blog
post series on evaluating and testing Machine Learning Models.

Here's a brief summary with links to the original blog posts

1.  [Orientation](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-machine-learning-models-part-1-orientation)
    Alice starts her blog series with an introduction to the jargon used
    in evaluation of Machine Learning Models. She talks about the three
    most important considerations when evaluating Machine learning
    models - picking the metric, picking the dataset on which to measure
    the metric and meta-evaluation of models.
2.  [Classsification
    Metrics](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-machine-learning-models-part-2a-classification-metrics)
    Alice talks about common metrics used when evaluating Classification
    based Machine learning Models.
3.  [Ranking and Regression
    Metrics](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-machine-learning-models-part-2b-ranking-and-regression-metrics)
    Alice talks about common metrics used when evaluating regression or
    ranking based machine learning models.
4.  [Hyperparameter
    Tuning](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-ml-models-part-3-validation-and-offline-testing)
    Hyperparamters are values that need to *supplied* to the
    training procedure. For example, the regularization parameter values
    used in some regression models.
5.  [Validation and offline
    Testing](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-ml-models-part-3-validation-and-offline-testing)
    She throws light on Boostrapping, Jack-knifing resampling techniques
    for Validation Testing.
6.  [Online A/B
    Testing](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-machine-learning-models-the-pitfalls-of-ab-testing)
    She throws light on the basics of A/B testing and its pitfalls.
