In a [post](http://www.ssushant.in/2020/04/06/using-notion-as-a-productivity-tool/) from before, I wrote about a new workflow that I had been following lately.  I took inspiration from the [PARA workflow](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/), and [checklists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto) to create a personal workflow.

The post was brief, and I feel that the Checklists' generation part needs a bit more elaboration. In this post, I wanted to expand upon one of the workflows. 
How can you create a new checklist or improve an existing list by reflecting upon what you did in your last project?

Let us understand this better with an example.

## Example

I work as a software engineer. In my day job, I review a lot of code.
I like to follow a checklist when reviewing any code. I made checklists for reviewing different source code files. 

During one of the recent code reviews, I came across many errors.
Finding and fixing all the errors by hand would have taken a lot of time.
I came across a linting tool - ESLint. Running ESLint on the source code found several other errors as well. Some of these errors could also be fixed automatically using ESlint.

I decided to add "Running ESLint on the source code" as a checklist item in my checklists database for code reviews.

The Checklist item is already linked to my "Code Review" Task template.

With time you will find that when you complete a job, you can create new checklists for doing the task or a similar task. You can also share the collection of lists with someone else in Notion!

## Summary

In this short blog post, I expanded on how new tasks and reflection upon how we did the job can let us build or refine checklists.

In later posts, I will expand how daily reading can also lead to creating new checklists.

Later!
