-   Everything about memory management\_. An interesting link about
    memory management, an area that I don't know much about because most
    of the languages I work in have built-in garbage collection.
-   [O'Reilly Introduction to Go
    Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035305.do). I
    started learning Go this month. John Graham-Cumming's Video lectures
    are my starting point and they are very good.
-   Go Indexing Library\_. An interesting library for text indexing.
-   Camlistore\_. A cms library in Go. Asset management applications in
    Media can use this library.
-   My tribute to Roger Ebert\_. My answer to a Quora question. Roger
    Ebert was my favourite film critic and his Great movies list is the
    best curation.
