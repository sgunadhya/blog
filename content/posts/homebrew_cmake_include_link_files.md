I was trying to build a project which had dependencies of [`gflags`](https://github.com/gflags/gflags) and `glog` and used [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/) as the build tools.

I was using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on MacOSX, so I went ahead and installed the dependencies like so:

``shell
brew install glog
brew install gflag
``
Now, I wanted to add include path and link path for these libs in the project.
My first shot was to add a `CXXFLAGS` variable and expected that `cmake` would pick it up.

```
export CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/Cellar/glog/0.3.4/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/gflags/2.1.2/include/"
```

`cmake` did not pick up this because it never used CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS.

Next, I added the dependency manually in the `CMakeLists.txt` file using the `include_directories` and `link_directories` like so:

```
include_directories(/usr/local/Cellar/glog/0.3.4/include)
include_directories(/usr/local/Cellar/gflags/2.1.2/include/)
link_directories(/usr/local/Cellar/glog/0.3.4/lib)
link_directories(/usr/local/Cellar/gflags/2.1.2/lib)
```

This approach was not scalable. I searched for a bit and found an acceptable solution. I added `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`
in the include and the link path respectively.

```
include_directories(/usr/local/include)
link_directories(/usr/local/lib)
```

This works! I am of the opinion that we can do better, but as of now I am okay with this.
