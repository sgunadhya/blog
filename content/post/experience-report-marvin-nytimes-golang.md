NYTimes recently open-sourced [Marvin](https://github.com/NYTimes/marvin), a library for building Microservices on Google AppEngine. The project is based off their earlier library [Gizmo](https://github.com/NYTimes/gizmo).
I was looking for a similar project to implement some of my own microservices, so I thought
that it was an opportune moment to give this toolkit a shot.

By way of documentation, the repository has a sample application, `readinglist`, and its documentation is lacking.
The `README` page has bit description about the files. It took me a while to understand the machinations because
I had not worked on Gizmo earlier.

Marvin is a toolkit to implement Microservices which use protocol buffers or JSON as their communication format. First off, Marvin expects an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification file. You use the spec file to generate a `.proto` file. [`openapi2proto`](https://github.com/NYTimes/openapi2proto) is another open source project from NYTimes which comes handy here.  You can then use the `.proto` file to generate Go code for services. Marvin's `MixService` interface gives you endpoints to implement protocol buffer and JSON Web Services.Here's a run-down of the workflow:

*  Write the `openapi` spec in a file, say `service.yaml`
*  Use `openapi2proto` to generate the service specification in Protobuf. The protobuf file has domain specific models from the openapi definitions.

   ```
   openapi2proto -spec service.yaml > service.proto
   ```

*  Generate Go code for the service using the protobuf compiler

   ```
   protoc --go _out= . service.proto
   ```

*  Implement the service method, usually it is the `marvin.MixService` which is an interface for implementing both `json` and `protobuf` services. I discovered [`impl`](https://github.com/josharian/impl), a utility to generate stub implementation for any interface. You can generate the stub implementation like so:

   ```
   impl 's Service' github.com/NYTimes/marvin.MixService
   ```

   You can then add custom middlewares, routing and Endpoints by implementing the methods from the interface.

* Write the usual `app.yaml` file for deploying the project on GAE. In the `main` function, bootstrap the service like so:

    {{< highlight go "linenos=table" >}}

	func main() {
		marvin.Init(api.NewService())
		appengine.Main()
    }
    {{< / highlight>}}

* Use the local setup to test your microservice

	```
	dev_appserver.py server/app.yml
	```

It took me a while to figure out the workflow. I liked the openapi-first approach for developing Microservice APIs.
While `openapi2proto` generates the domain objects from the definitions file, it discards the endpoints information,
which you have to implement separately. It'd be nice to generate stub implementation from the `paths` section of
the spec file. To sum up:

* You can generate protobuf and JSON webservices is a huge plus.
* You can generate neat documentation from `swagger-gen` tool for your APIs.
* It'd be great if the tool also generated stub implementation for the endpoints using the `paths` information from
the `openapi` spec file.
