We see sketches everywhere. We doodle when we are bored. We doodle our design
ideas on a piece of paper, a napkin, or in a software program. Sketching or
doodling as a means of communication harks backs to when we drew pictograms on
caves. Many of the famous thought leaders, scientists, philosophers and physisits
kept sketch notebooks.[Leonardo Da Vinci's famous notebooks](http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Arundel_MS_263)
give deep insights into this mind. Fermat famously doodled an insight into the

Enterprise-Architect who would design an enterprise-y blueprint using the Java
EE technologies. I have seen my fair share of EJBs and

a solution to a class of problems. You can not have a general purpose architecture.
