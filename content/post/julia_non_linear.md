In a [previous post](https://www.ssushant.in/2016/09/10/using-julia-for-linear-programming/), I discussed using Julia for Linear Programming. It turns out, Julia's JuMP package can also be used for Non linear optimization and root finding.

To use JuMP's non linear solvers, you'll need to install a non linear solver package, for example `Ipopt`.

```jl
Pkg.add("Ipopt")
```

On my mac, Julia installed the non linear optimization package `ipopt` using `homebrew`.

Let's try to solve an unconstrained optimization problem - find the minimum of `-80*x^2 + 26000*x -2000000`.

First, we load the `JuMP` package like so:

```jl
using JuMP
```

We model the problem:

```jl

using Ipopt

m = Model(solver=IpoptSolver())
@variable(m, x)
@NLobjective(m, Max, -80*x^2 + 26000*x -2000000)

```
As you can see, you'll need to pass the custom solver `IpoptSolver` to the model.

Next, we try to find the optimum solution


```jl
solve(m)

```

Here's the output from my workstation:


```bash
This is Ipopt version 3.12.4, running with linear solver mumps.
NOTE: Other linear solvers might be more efficient (see Ipopt documentation).

EXIT: Optimal Solution Found.
:Optimal

```

From the output, it looks like we found the optimal solution.

To show the value of x at the optimum point, we use the `getvalue` function.

```jl
julia> getvalue(x)
162.5

```

In this post, I used the `JuMP` package for non linear optimization.
JuMP is a convenient and useful tool and should be in every modeler's toolbox.
It is turning out to be an uber package for optimization. I'll continue blogging
as I explore the JuMP package.
