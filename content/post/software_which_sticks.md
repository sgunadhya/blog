One of my main routines now a days is to lurk around the Notionso reddit, and find nuggets of wisdom for
my own setup. I came across the post which I resonated with me.

{{< reddit "https://www.reddit.com/r/NotionSo/comments/glkm7w/unpopular_opinion_this_community_is_going_the_way/" >}}

I was on the same boat until some years ago. I invested in "fashion more than function". Until recently,
when I figured out that I needed a system so that instead of thinking about being productive, I could actually be.
The idea of how software can make way for more such routines and habits still piques my interest.


Janet Murrary, in her book, Interaction Design describes modes of interaction. The modes of interaction are modalities
or mental models with which we approach our interaction with digital entities. 
The models are:

* ### The Database Model ###

	#### Notion as a Relational Database ####
	
	#### Notion and Boundary Objects ####

* ### The Structured Document Model ###

	#### Notion As a Wiki ####
	
	
	#### Notion and Metadata ####
	
	Take a look at Notion's page. It has metadata!

* ### The Tool Model ###

	#### Notion as a CRM ####
	
	#### Notion on Different Devices ####
	
	#### Notion as an Editor ####
	
	Notion exposes Markdown Editing
	

* ### The Machine Model ###

	#### A System in Notion ####
	
	#### An Appliance in Notion ####
	
	#### Dashboard is the Control Panel ####
	
	Users have made fantastic dashboards of their front page in Notion.
	
* ### The Game Model ###

*  ### The Companion Model ###

	When I say software as a companion, the imagery ranges from your software on iPad or Mac to 
	perfidious software programs in Sci-Fi like HAL. 
	
	
	#### The "Second Brain" is the Secretary ####
	
	Take the example of using Notion as a Second Brain. When we talk about the synecdoche - "Second Brain",
	we are talking about using Notion as a companion, a secretary if you will. We offload 
	our cognitive load to a secretary so that we can focus on the more important tasks at hand. As part of 
	using Notion as a Second Brain, we offload cogntive load and processing to Notion.
	
	#### Does it "Spark Joy"? ####
	
	Another use of Notion is an extension of the self, you can call it Second Self. Notion allows the user
	to customize the interface to their heart's content. Such customization helped drive the rise in users
	sharing their templates for reuse and admiration. The ability to customize the interface with emojis and
	stock images is the centripetal force which bolstered its adoption. 
	If the interface "sparks joy", then the user is motivated to spend more time.


* Conclusions
