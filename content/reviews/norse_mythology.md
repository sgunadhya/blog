*Norse Mythology* is a retelling of the classic fables and myths of the Norse Mythology.
Neil Gaiman, the author, collates myths of the Old Norse from different sources,
most notably from the epic [*Edda*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edda), and presents them in a novella form. The result
is a swooping collection of short stories which reads like a short fantasy novella
much like [Neil Gaiman's other works](https://www.ssushant.in/2016/09/30/american-gods/).

Norse religion was a folk religion of the ancient Germanic tribes from North
European countries like Scandinavia. The practitioners were nature-worshippers and
deified forces of nature like Thunder, Earth and unknown phenomena in Nature. In the
Norse pantheon the universe is split in several realms like Midgard, the realm of
Humans, and Asgard, the realm of the Gods. Niflheim is the realm of the dead, and
Jottenheim is the realm of the Giants. Aesir, the Gods, are in a constant struggle with
the Giants who wish to gain control of Asgard. Odin, Thor and Loki are the main
players in this fantasy opera. Odin is an omniscient old God who represents Wisdom.
Thor is a strong God who is the de facto leader in possession of Mjolnir, a strong
hammer which he uses to decimate the enemies. Loki is a mischief monger, a conniving
trickster whom Gods tolerate because of his usefulness and knack to get out of difficult
situation using his wits. The collection of stories recount how Gods came to be, their
genealogy, how they get their weapons and how they fall into trap and get out of difficult
situations because of Loki's pranks. The narrative culminates in an ultimate battle
called as the [Ragnarok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k) or the twilight of the Gods. Ragnarok is an elaborate playbook
about the end of the World where the Gods will battle out the Sons of Loki to their deaths.

Myths are collection of narratives which systematize the beliefs of yore. The narratives
are cautionary tales, made-up explanations of natural phenomena or even silly, peevish
and delightful gossips. Sample this - Odin stole mead from the Giants which gives them
the gift of poetry whereas his farts on Giant in his Eagle-form gave birth to bad
poetry. The earthquakes are the result of Loki writhing in pain when venom drips on him.
There is no higher morality, no original sin. The Gods are playful, sometimes peevish;
they err, face the consequences of their actions, fight and meet their tragic ends. The
fables are tales of deceit, follies and getting out of difficult situations. There is the
inevitable apocalypse, but no sin, morality, redemption or judgment. It is what it is -
no-frills, absurdist, fun, tragic, bittersweet myth.

My interest in Mythology piqued when I played the strategy game, [Age of Mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology), in
my teenage years. The game is an ultimate simulation of the clash of the Titans. You control
a Pantheon - one from Greek, Egyptian and Norse, and end up playing against another Pantheon.
Much like chess pieces, you control a civilization and wage war against the other. It is
pure fun when a [Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur) from the Greek pantheon decimates an army of wolves led by [Fenrir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir) from the
Norse Pantheon. The game was my gateway drug to explore comparative mythology. One thing
led to other and I ended up reading the entire [*Masks of God Series*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell#The_Masks_of_God) from Joseph Campbell.
In his book [*Myths to Live by*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myths_to_Live_By), Joseph Campbell says that the myths are proxies of our inner psyche.
Odin, Thor and Loki should represent something. If wisdom from Odin and courage from Thor are
pure virtues, then shouldn't Loki's chutzpah count? Loki represents our rebellious self.
Loki's risk-taking is an underrated trait. Risk is what drives us. Isn't our zeitgeist portfolio
society about it?
