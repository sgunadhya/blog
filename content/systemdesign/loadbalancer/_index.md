# Solutions
Okay, let's break down how to implement the canonical solution patterns for the Performance & Scalability issues using common load balancer configurations (like Cloud Providers, NGINX, HAProxy).

Remember, load balancer configuration is typically declarative (YAML, text files) rather than procedural code like Java or Rust. However, understanding these concepts is crucial for building robust systems.



## Scalable Load Balancing Pattern

### Problem Solved
Throughput saturation (Packet Processing, Bandwidth, CPU limits on the LB itself).
### Core Idea
Don't rely on a single, fixed-size load balancer. Distribute the load balancing function itself horizontally and ensure ample capacity.

### **Implementation**

#### Cloud Providers 

(AWS ELB/ALB/NLB, Azure Load Balancer, GCP Cloud Load Balancing)

##### How

These services are *designed* for this pattern. They are managed services that automatically scale their underlying capacity based on traffic demand. You don't manage individual LB instances.

* **Configuration/APIs:**
  * **Choose the Right Type:**
    * **AWS**: Use Network Load Balancer (NLB) for highest network throughput (millions of PPS), TCP/TLS traffic, and static IPs. Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/S routing, path-based routing, WAF integration, etc. (scales very well but has different capacity characteristics than NLB).
    * Azure: Standard Load Balancer scales automatically. Choose based on L4 vs L7 needs (Application Gateway for L7).
    * GCP: Choose appropriate type (e.g., Global External HTTP(S) LB, Regional Network LB). They scale managedly.
  * **Backend Autoscaling:** Ensure your backend instances (EC2, VMs, Containers, Functions) are managed by an Autoscaling Group (ASG) or equivalent (Managed Instance Group, VM Scale Set). The load balancer automatically adds/removes targets as the group scales.
  * **Monitoring:** Monitor the load balancer's own metrics (e.g., AWS `ConsumedLCUs` for ALB, `ActiveFlowCount` for NLB, Azure `SNAT Connection Count`, GCP LB metrics) to understand usage, though scaling is generally automatic up to service limits. Request limit increases if needed.
  * **Headroom:** Configure backend ASG policies to scale *proactively* based on metrics like CPU, request count per instance, or queue depth, ensuring there's always spare backend capacity *before* the load balancer needs to throttle.

#### Self-Managed 
(NGINX, HAProxy)
* **How:** You need to run *multiple* instances of NGINX/HAProxy and distribute traffic *to* them.
* **Configuration/APIs:**
    * **Distribution Layer:**
        * **DNS Round Robin:** Simplest but uneven distribution and slow failover.
        * **Cloud Network LB:** Place an AWS NLB, Azure Standard LB (L4), or GCP Network LB *in front* of your NGINX/HAProxy instances. The cloud LB handles scaling and distribution to your LB tier.
        * **BGP/ECMP (On-Prem/Advanced):** Use routing protocols to advertise the same IP from multiple LB instances, letting routers distribute traffic (requires network team involvement).
    * **High Availability (HA):** Use tools like `keepalived` (VRRP) for active/passive or active/active setups if not using a higher-level distribution method like a cloud NLB.
    * **Instance Scaling:** Run your NGINX/HAProxy instances within an Autoscaling Group (if in the cloud) so the LB tier itself can scale.
    * **Configuration Example (Conceptual - using Cloud NLB):**

    ```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Internet["Internet"] --> CloudLB["AWS NLB / Azure LB / GCP Network LB"]
    CloudLB --> NginxLayer["ASG of NGINX/HAProxy Instances"]
    NginxLayer --> BackendServers["Backend App Servers"]    ```
        
    * **NGINX/HAProxy Config:** The individual configs don't change much for *this* pattern, it's about deploying *multiple copies* effectively.

---

## Connection Management Pattern**

* **Problem Solved:** Connection exhaustion (running out of connection table entries, ephemeral ports, or file descriptors).
* **Core Idea:** Tune operating system and load balancer limits, manage timeouts effectively, and potentially limit connections per client.

* **Implementation:**

    * **Cloud Providers:**
        * **How:** Limits are often high but exist. Focus on timeouts and choosing the right LB type.
        * **Configuration/APIs:**
            * **Check Service Quotas:** Understand the documented connection limits for your chosen LB type (e.g., AWS ALB/NLB limits, Azure LB limits).
            * **Idle Timeouts:** Configure appropriate idle timeouts. Longer timeouts hold connections open; shorter timeouts reclaim resources faster but might break long-polling/WebSockets. (e.g., AWS ALB `idle_timeout.timeout_seconds`, Azure LB Idle Timeout). NLBs are generally better for very long-lived connections.
            * **Client IP Preservation:** Ensure backend servers see the actual client IP (using Proxy Protocol or X-Forwarded-For) if they need to manage connections based on client.

    * **Self-Managed (NGINX, HAProxy):**
        * **How:** Direct control over OS and LB parameters.
        * **Configuration/APIs:**
            * **Operating System Tuning (`sysctl.conf`, `limits.conf`):**
                * `net.core.somaxconn`: Max backlog of pending connections (e.g., `65535`).
                * `net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog`: Max SYN queue size (e.g., `65535`).
                * `fs.file-max`: System-wide max file descriptors (e.g., `200000` or more).
                * `nofile` (via `ulimit` or `/etc/security/limits.conf` or systemd unit file): Max file descriptors *per process* (e.g., `65535` or `1048576`). Connections consume file descriptors.
            * **NGINX (`nginx.conf`):**
                * `worker_processes auto;` (Usually set to number of CPU cores).
                * `worker_rlimit_nofile 65535;` (Set worker process file descriptor limit).
                * `events { worker_connections 16384; }` (Max connections *per worker*. Total ≈ `worker_processes * worker_connections`, limited by `nofile`).
                * `keepalive_timeout 65;` (Adjust idle connection timeout).
                * `keepalive_requests 1000;` (Max requests per keepalive connection).
                * `client_header_timeout`, `client_body_timeout`, `send_timeout`: Tune client timeouts.
                * **Client Limiting:**
                    ```nginx
                    http {
                        limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m; # Define zone based on client IP
                        server {

## Optimized TLS Pattern**

* **Problem Solved:** SSL/TLS processing bottlenecks (high CPU usage during handshakes).
* **Core Idea:** Use hardware acceleration where possible, optimize cipher selection, and enable session reuse mechanisms.

* **Implementation:**

    * **Cloud Providers:**
        * **How:** Leverage built-in optimizations and hardware acceleration.
        * **Configuration/APIs:**
            * **Hardware Acceleration:** Usually handled automatically by the managed service.
            * **Security Policies:** Select predefined TLS Security Policies (e.g., AWS `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06`, Azure App Gateway SSL Policies) that balance security and performance. Avoid legacy policies unless absolutely required. Check cipher suites included in the policy.
            * **Session Resumption:** Typically enabled by default (Session IDs/Tickets). Verify in documentation if specific controls exist.
            * **Protocols:** Ensure modern protocols like TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are enabled in the policy.

    * **Self-Managed (NGINX, HAProxy):**
        * **How:** Explicit configuration of ciphers, protocols, session caching, and potentially linking against hardware acceleration libraries.
        * **Configuration/APIs:**
            * **Hardware Acceleration:** If your hardware supports it (e.g., Intel QAT, specialized cards), you may need specific builds of NGINX/HAProxy or OpenSSL compiled with engine support. Consult hardware/software documentation.
            * **NGINX (`nginx.conf` - within `server` block `listen ... ssl`):**
                ```nginx
                ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
                ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
                # Example: Modern cipher suite prioritizing AEAD ciphers
                ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384';
                ssl_ecdh_curve prime256v1:secp384r1; # Efficient curves

                # Session Cache (Session IDs)
                ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m; # 10MB cache (~40,000 sessions)
                ssl_session_timeout 10m;

                # Session Tickets (Alternative/complementary, keys need rotation)
                ssl_session_tickets on;
                # ssl_session_ticket_key /path/to/ticket.key; # Needs secure generation and rotation
                ```
            * **HAProxy (`haproxy.cfg` - within `bind` line):**
                ```haproxy
                # Global or frontend/defaults section
                tune.ssl.default-dh-param 2048
                ssl-default-bind-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
                ssl-default-bind-options ssl-min-ver TLSv1.2 # Enforce minimum TLS version

                frontend myfrontend
                   bind *:443 ssl crt /path/to/cert.pem alpn h2,http/1.1 # Add ciphers/options here if not default
                   # Session resumption enabled by default, session cache automatic
                ```

## Coordinated Scaling Pattern**

* **Problem Solved:** Uneven scaling across tiers in a multi-layer LB architecture (e.g., external LB scales but internal LB doesn't, creating a bottleneck).
* **Core Idea:** Link or coordinate the scaling actions across different tiers based on relevant, potentially cross-tier, metrics.

* **Implementation:** (This is more architectural and automation-focused than specific LB config)

    * **Cloud Providers:**
        * **How:** Use cloud monitoring and autoscaling features, potentially with custom logic.
        * **Configuration/APIs:**
            * **Tiered Monitoring:** Set up monitoring (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring) for key metrics at *each* tier (e.g., Edge LB connections/throughput, Internal LB active connections/latency, App Server CPU/Memory/Queue).
            * **Independent Scaling:** Ensure each tier (Edge LB Target Group ASG, Internal LB Target Group ASG, App Tier ASG) has its *own* autoscaling policies based on its *most relevant* metrics.
            * **Cross-Tier Triggers (Advanced):**
                * Use custom metrics or Lambda/Functions triggered by alarms. Example: If Edge LB `ActiveFlowCount` > Threshold *AND* Internal LB `TargetResponseTime` > Threshold, trigger scaling of the *Internal LB's ASG* or even the *App Tier's ASG*.
                * AWS: CloudWatch Metric Math can create combined metrics for alarms. Step Functions or Lambda can implement more complex scaling logic.
                * Azure: Azure Monitor action groups can trigger Azure Functions or Logic Apps.
                * GCP: Cloud Monitoring alerting can trigger Cloud Functions or Pub/Sub.
            * **Capacity Headroom:** Over-provision slightly or set scaling thresholds lower at downstream tiers so they can react *before* becoming bottlenecks when an upstream tier scales up traffic.

    * **Self-Managed (NGINX, HAProxy) + Orchestration (Kubernetes, etc.):**
        * **How:** Combine LB metrics with orchestration platform scaling.
        * **Configuration/APIs:**
            * **Metrics Exposure:** Ensure your LBs expose detailed metrics (e.g., using `nginx-prometheus-exporter`, HAProxy's built-in Prometheus endpoint, or stats socket).
            * **Monitoring System:** Scrape metrics using Prometheus or similar.
            * **Kubernetes HPA:** Use Horizontal Pod Autoscalers.
                * Scale LB deployments based on their own CPU/Memory or custom metrics (e.g., active connections scraped by Prometheus Adapter).
                * Scale backend application deployments based on their CPU/Memory, custom metrics (e.g., RPS per pod), or external metrics (like queue length).
            * **Custom Controllers/Operators:** For complex coordination logic (similar to the cloud Lambda approach), a custom Kubernetes operator might observe metrics across different deployments/services and adjust HPA targets or replica counts directly.
            * **Service Mesh:** If using a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd), leverage its observability and potentially traffic splitting capabilities to manage scaling and load distribution internally. The external LB still needs to scale appropriately.
