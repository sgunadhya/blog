## Solutions

Okay, let's break down how to implement these canonical solution patterns using common stream processing APIs, primarily focusing on Apache Flink and Kafka Streams, as they are popular choices often used with Java. Spark Structured Streaming shares some concepts too.

Remember, these are *patterns*, so the exact implementation depends heavily on the specific framework, connectors, and application logic. The focus here is on the *API features* and *concepts* used to realize the pattern.

---

**1. State Optimization Pattern**

* **Goal:** Improve performance by efficiently managing state size and access.
* **Implementation Concepts:**
    * **Partitioning/Keying:** Distribute state based on keys.
        * **Flink:** Use `stream.keyBy(keySelector)` before stateful operations. Data is partitioned across parallel instances based on the key's hash.
        * **Kafka Streams:** Implicitly partitions based on the stream's key. Ensure data is correctly keyed *before* stateful operations like `aggregate`, `reduce`, or processing `KTable`s. Use `groupByKey()` or `groupBy()` followed by stateful ops.
    * **State Backend Selection/Tuning:** Choose and configure the right storage.
        * **Flink:** Configure in `flink-conf.yaml` or programmatically (`env.setStateBackend(...)`). Options: `HashMapStateBackend` (Memory, fast, for small state), `RocksDBStateBackend` (On-disk/off-heap, scalable, default for many deployments). Tune RocksDB via `flink-conf.yaml` (e.g., memory ratios, block cache, write buffers).
        * **Kafka Streams:** Configure via `StreamsConfig`. Options: `InMemoryKeyValueStore`, `RocksDBKeyValueStore` (default). Tune RocksDB via `RocksDBConfigSetter` implementation passed in config.
    * **Efficient Access Patterns:** Minimize state reads/writes. Use appropriate state primitives.
        * **Flink:** Use `ValueState`, `MapState`, `ListState`, `AggregatingState`, `ReducingState` judiciously. Avoid reading/writing large objects frequently. Consider caching frequently accessed state in transient variables within the function (if consistency allows). Use TTL (`StateTtlConfig`) to automatically clean up old state.
        * **Kafka Streams:** Use `KeyValueStore`, `WindowStore`, `SessionStore`. Leverage incremental aggregations (`aggregate`, `reduce`) which are often more efficient than recomputing from raw events.

```java
// Flink Example (Keying + State Access)
stream
    .keyBy(event -> event.getDeviceId())
    .process(new KeyedProcessFunction<String, Event, Output>() {
        private transient ValueState<Long> countState;

        @Override
        public void open(Configuration parameters) throws Exception {
            ValueStateDescriptor<Long> descriptor = new ValueStateDescriptor<>("deviceCount", Long.class);
            // Add TTL config here if needed
            countState = getRuntimeContext().getState(descriptor);
        }

        @Override
        public void processElement(Event value, Context ctx, Collector<Output> out) throws Exception {
            Long currentCount = countState.value();
            if (currentCount == null) {
                currentCount = 0L;
            }
            countState.update(currentCount + 1);
            // ... process further
        }
    });

// Kafka Streams Example (Keying + State Access)
KStream<String, Event> stream = ...;
stream
    .groupByKey() // Assumes stream is already keyed correctly
    .aggregate(
        () -> 0L, // Initializer
        (key, value, aggregate) -> aggregate + 1, // Aggregator
        Materialized.<String, Long, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>>as("device-counts") // State store
            .withValueSerde(Serdes.Long())
    );
```

**2. Pipeline Balancing Pattern**

* **Goal:** Prevent backpressure by identifying and resolving bottlenecks.
* **Implementation Concepts:**
    * **Monitoring:** Identify slow operators.
        * **Flink:** Use the Web UI's Backpressure tab. Monitor task manager metrics (CPU, network queues, `busyTimeMsPerSecond`).
        * **Kafka Streams:** Monitor Kafka consumer lag (`kafka-consumer-groups.sh`), process/thread CPU utilization, custom metrics via `KafkaStreams#metrics()`.
    * **Selective Parallelism:** Increase resources for slow operators.
        * **Flink:** Use `operator.setParallelism(N)` after an operator definition. Requires careful planning as upstream/downstream parallelism might need adjustment. Can sometimes be done via UI for stateless operators.
        * **Kafka Streams:** Increase `num.stream.threads` in `StreamsConfig` (scales the whole instance). For specific bottlenecks, often requires repartitioning the input topic (`stream.through("repartition-topic")`) or breaking the flow into separate sub-topologies (less common).
    * **Operator Chaining Control:** Prevent fast operators from being fused with slow ones.
        * **Flink:** Use `operator.disableChaining()` or `operator.startNewChain()`.
        * **Kafka Streams:** Less direct control; topology optimization handles some fusion. Repartitioning (`through`) naturally breaks chains.

```java
// Flink Example (Selective Parallelism)
stream
    .map(new FastTransformation()).setParallelism(4) // Default/lower parallelism
    .keyBy(...)
    .process(new ComplexStatefulLogic()).setParallelism(16) // Higher parallelism for bottleneck
    .addSink(new SlowSink()).setParallelism(16); // Match sink parallelism
```

---

**3. Non-blocking Checkpoint Pattern**

* **Goal:** Minimize processing pauses during checkpoints (primarily a Flink concept).
* **Implementation Concepts:**
    * **Incremental Checkpoints:** Only upload state *changes* since the last checkpoint (RocksDB backend).
        * **Flink:** Enabled by default when using `RocksDBStateBackend`. Configure via `state.checkpoints.incremental: true`.
    * **Asynchronous Snapshots:** Perform state snapshotting without blocking the main processing path.
        * **Flink:** Configure `state.backend.rocksdb.checkpoint.transfer.async: true`. Use asynchronous state backends if available/applicable.
    * **Unaligned Checkpoints:** Allow checkpoint barriers to overtake in-flight data buffers, reducing alignment time for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios.
        * **Flink:** `env.getCheckpointConfig().enableUnalignedCheckpoints(true);`. Trade-off: can increase checkpoint size during backpressure.

```java
// Flink Example (Configuration)
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
CheckpointConfig checkpointConfig = env.getCheckpointConfig();

env.enableCheckpointing(60000, CheckpointingMode.EXACTLY_ONCE); // e.g., every 60s
checkpointConfig.setCheckpointStorage("hdfs:///flink/checkpoints"); // Or s3://...
checkpointConfig.enableUnalignedCheckpoints(true); // Optional: for low latency
checkpointConfig.setCheckpointTimeout(120000); // Allow 2 minutes for checkpoints

// In flink-conf.yaml (for RocksDB):
// state.backend: rocksdb
// state.checkpoints.incremental: true
// state.backend.rocksdb.checkpoint.transfer.async: true
```

**4. Efficient Windowing Pattern**

* **Goal:** Manage window state and computation, handle late events.
* **Implementation Concepts:**
    * **Incremental Aggregation:** Compute aggregates as events arrive, not all at once when the window closes.
        * **Flink:** Use `aggregate(AggregateFunction)` or `reduce(ReduceFunction)` on `WindowedStream`. Avoid `apply(WindowFunction)` or `process(ProcessWindowFunction)` if only simple aggregation is needed, or combine them (`aggregate(aggFunc, processWindowFunc)`).
        * **Kafka Streams:** `aggregate()` on `TimeWindowedKStream` or `SessionWindowedKStream` is inherently incremental.
    * **Late Event Handling:** Define a policy for data arriving after the watermark passes the window end.
        * **Flink:** `windowedStream.allowedLateness(Time.minutes(1))` keeps window state longer. `windowedStream.sideOutputLateData(outputTag)` sends very late data to a separate stream.
        * **Kafka Streams:** Use `windowedBy(...).grace(Duration.ofMinutes(1))` within the `Materialized` store config to allow late arrivals to update the window result.
    * **State TTL/Eviction:** Automatically clean up window state (or general keyed state).
        * **Flink:** For general keyed state, use `StateTtlConfig`. For window state, `allowedLateness` implicitly manages cleanup, but be mindful of state size during the lateness period.
        * **Kafka Streams:** Window state is typically cleaned up based on retention period (`Materialized.as(...).withRetention(...)`).

```java
// Flink Example (Incremental Aggregation + Lateness)
OutputTag<Event> lateEventsTag = new OutputTag<Event>("late-events"){};
DataStream<Result> resultStream = stream
    .keyBy(event -> event.getKey())
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.minutes(5)))
    .allowedLateness(Time.minutes(1))
    .sideOutputLateData(lateEventsTag)
    .aggregate(new MyIncrementalAggregator(), new MyWindowProcessor()); // Incremental + optional final processing

DataStream<Event> lateStream = resultStream.getSideOutput(lateEventsTag);

// Kafka Streams Example (Incremental Aggregation + Grace Period)
KStream<String, Event> stream = ...;
stream
    .groupByKey()
    .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)).grace(Duration.ofMinutes(1))) // 5 min window, 1 min grace
    .aggregate(
        () -> 0.0, // Initializer
        (key, value, aggregate) -> aggregate + value.getAmount(), // Incremental Aggregator
        Materialized.<String, Double, WindowStore<Bytes, byte[]>>as("windowed-sum")
            .withValueSerde(Serdes.Double())
            // .withRetention(Duration.ofHours(1)) // Optional: control store retention
    )
    .toStream()
    // ... process results
```

---

**5. Transactional Sink Pattern**

* **Goal:** Achieve end-to-end exactly-once semantics by coordinating sink writes with processing state commits.
* **Implementation Concepts:**
    * **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** A protocol involving pre-commit/commit phases coordinated by the framework.
        * **Flink:** Implement `TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction`. Connectors like `FlinkKafkaProducer` (with `Semantic.EXACTLY_ONCE`), `JdbcSink.exactlyOnceSink`, `Elasticsearch7SinkBuilder` (with specific configs) provide this.
        * **Kafka Streams:** Enable EOS (`processing.guarantee="exactly_once_v2"`). The framework uses Kafka transactions to atomically commit input offsets, state store changes, and output production to Kafka topics. Sinks consuming *from* Kafka need to read `read_committed`. Non-Kafka sinks require manual implementation of idempotence or transactional writes within the user code (e.g., in `process()`, `transform()`).
    * **Idempotent Writes:** Design the sink so that writing the same message multiple times has no adverse effect.
        * **Flink/Kafka Streams/Spark:** Often required if the sink doesn't support 2PC or transactions. Requires careful design based on unique message IDs or state managed within the sink system.

```java
// Flink Example (Kafka Exactly-Once Sink)
Properties kafkaProps = new Properties();
kafkaProps.setProperty("bootstrap.servers", "...");
// Set transactional.id prefix, etc. if needed by broker config

FlinkKafkaProducer<String> kafkaSink = new FlinkKafkaProducer<>(
    "output-topic",
    new SimpleStringSchema(),
    kafkaProps,
    FlinkKafkaProducer.Semantic.EXACTLY_ONCE // Key configuration
);
stream.addSink(kafkaSink);

// Kafka Streams Example (EOS Configuration)
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "my-eos-app");
props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "...");
props.put(StreamsConfig.PROCESSING_GUARANTEE_CONFIG, StreamsConfig.EXACTLY_ONCE_V2); // Enable EOS
// Ensure producer/consumer configs within Kafka Streams align (e.g., enable idempotence)

KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, props);
streams.start();
```

---

**6. Adaptive Watermark Pattern**

* **Goal:** Generate accurate watermarks that reflect event time progress, accounting for out-of-orderness and source idleness.
* **Implementation Concepts:**
    * **Bounded Out-of-Orderness:** Assume events won't be later than a certain duration.
        * **Flink:** `WatermarkStrategy.forBoundedOutOfOrderness(Duration.ofSeconds(10))`
    * **Timestamp Assignment:** Extract event time from records.
        * **Flink:** `.withTimestampAssigner((event, recordTimestamp) -> event.getEventTimestamp())`
    * **Idleness Handling:** Ensure watermarks advance even if some partitions/sources are temporarily silent.
        * **Flink:** `.withIdleness(Duration.ofMinutes(1))`
    * **Custom Logic:** Implement complex heuristics if needed.
        * **Flink:** Implement `WatermarkGenerator`.
    * **Kafka Streams/Spark:** Watermark logic is often simpler. Kafka Streams primarily advances based on observed timestamps. Spark uses `withWatermark("eventTimeCol", "10 minutes")`. Late data handling depends on window configuration or output modes.

```java
// Flink Example
WatermarkStrategy<MyEvent> watermarkStrategy = WatermarkStrategy
    .<MyEvent>forBoundedOutOfOrderness(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) // Allow 30s lateness
    .withTimestampAssigner((event, timestamp) -> event.getTimestampMillis())
    .withIdleness(Duration.ofMinutes(2)); // If a partition is idle for 2m, advance WM

DataStream<MyEvent> streamWithTimestamps = kafkaSource
    .assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(watermarkStrategy);
```

---
7. Synchronized Watermark Pattern

Goal: Ensure correct time-based operations (like joins, co-processing) when consuming from multiple input streams or partitions with potentially different event time characteristics.

Implementation Concepts:

Watermark Alignment: The framework needs to ensure that operators processing multiple inputs only advance their internal watermark (and thus trigger time-based operations) based on the minimum watermark across all inputs.

Idle Source Handling: Prevent a single idle input stream/partition from stalling watermark progress indefinitely.

APIs & Features:

Flink: This is handled automatically by the framework for operators connecting multiple streams (connect, join, union, coProcess). The operator's current watermark is the minimum of the watermarks from all its input channels. Using WatermarkStrategy...withIdleness() on each input stream is crucial to handle idle sources gracefully.

Kafka Streams: Stream time is generally advanced based on the maximum timestamp observed across all partitions of the input topics for a given task. For joins (KStream#join, KTable#join), the join windows and grace periods implicitly handle time synchronization based on record timestamps. Correct timestamp extraction and potentially using WallclockTimestampExtractor (if processing time alignment is acceptable in some cases) are important. There isn't a direct equivalent to Flink's explicit per-input idleness configuration; partition-level watermarks are less explicit.

Spark SS: Similar to Flink, multi-input operators (union, join) implicitly use the minimum watermark across inputs to determine the overall watermark for triggering time-based operations. withWatermark needs to be defined on each input DataFrame involved in event-time operations.

// Flink Example (Implicit Handling + Idleness)
WatermarkStrategy<EventA> strategyA = WatermarkStrategy.<EventA>forBoundedOutOfOrderness(...)
    .withTimestampAssigner(...)
    .withIdleness(Duration.ofMinutes(2)); // Handle idleness for stream A
WatermarkStrategy<EventB> strategyB = WatermarkStrategy.<EventB>forBoundedOutOfOrderness(...)
    .withTimestampAssigner(...)
    .withIdleness(Duration.ofMinutes(2)); // Handle idleness for stream B

DataStream<EventA> streamA = sourceA.assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(strategyA);
DataStream<EventB> sourceB = sourceB.assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(strategyB);

// Flink automatically aligns watermarks for the join
DataStream<Result> joined = streamA.join(streamB)
    .where(a -> a.getKey())
    .equalTo(b -> b.getKey())
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.minutes(10)))
    .apply(...);

// Union also aligns watermarks automatically
// DataStream<EventParent> unioned = streamA.union(streamB.map(b -> (EventParent)b));

8. Consistent Recovery Pattern

Goal: Ensure that upon recovery from failure, the application state is consistent with the reprocessed input data (no duplicates or data loss due to recovery).

Implementation Concepts:

Atomic State/Offset Commits: The framework must guarantee that the state snapshot (checkpoint/state store update) and the corresponding input source offsets are committed together atomically.

APIs & Features:

Flink: Achieved via its checkpointing mechanism (CheckpointingMode.EXACTLY_ONCE). Flink coordinates checkpoint barriers, state snapshotting (for all state backends), and committing offsets for sources that implement the CheckpointedFunction or use specific connectors (like FlinkKafkaConsumer). Savepoints provide manually triggered, consistent snapshots.

Kafka Streams: Achieved via EOS (processing.guarantee="exactly_once_v2"). It uses Kafka transactions to atomically commit input topic offsets (consumer offsets), state store updates (via changelog topics), and output topic production within a single transaction.

Spark SS: Relies on checkpointing (checkpointLocation) which saves offsets and state. Requires replayable sources (like Kafka) and often idempotent or transactional sinks for end-to-end guarantees.

// Flink Example (Configuration Driven)
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
// This setting is key for Flink's consistent recovery
env.enableCheckpointing(60000, CheckpointingMode.EXACTLY_ONCE);
// Use checkpointing-aware sources (e.g., FlinkKafkaConsumer)
// ... rest of topology ...

// Kafka Streams Example (Configuration Driven)
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(StreamsConfig.PROCESSING_GUARANTEE_CONFIG, StreamsConfig.EXACTLY_ONCE_V2);
// ... other Kafka Streams config ...
KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, props);
streams.start(); // EOS handles consistency

9. Stateful Upgrade Pattern

Goal: Upgrade application logic without losing state or causing significant downtime.

Implementation Concepts:

Consistent State Snapshots: Ability to take a complete, consistent snapshot of the application state (Savepoints in Flink).

State Compatibility/Evolution: Ensuring the new application version can read the state format of the old version, or providing a migration path.

Operator State Mapping: Ability to map state from operators in the old job version to operators in the new version (usually via stable unique identifiers).

APIs & Features:

Flink:

Savepoints: Trigger manually (flink savepoint <jobId> ...).

UIDs: Assign stable unique IDs using .uid("my-operator-v1") on stateful operators.

State Schema Evolution: Requires state serializers to support evolution (e.g., Avro, Protobuf, or Flink's POJO/Kryo serializers with care). Flink's State Processor API can be used for complex offline state migrations.

Process: Trigger savepoint -> Stop old job -> Deploy new job version restoring from the savepoint (flink run -s <savepointPath> ...).

Kafka Streams: More complex, often involves application-level strategies.

Deploy new version with a different application.id, process data in parallel for a while (dual write/read).

Use Kafka Streams state restoration listeners (StateListener, StandbyUpdateListener) for custom logic during rehydration.

Manually migrate state using custom tools reading from state store backups or changelog topics if schema changes are complex.

Spark SS: Relies on checkpoint compatibility. Stopping a job and restarting a new version from the same checkpoint location works if the code/state schema is compatible. Complex migrations often require manual intervention.

// Flink Example (UIDs for Mapping)
stream
    .keyBy(event -> event.getCustomerId())
    .process(new CustomerStateProcessor())
    .uid("customer-processor-v1"); // CRUCIAL for savepoint mapping

// Flink CLI commands (Conceptual)
// 1. ./bin/flink savepoint <runningJobId> hdfs:///flink/savepoints/
// 2. ./bin/flink cancel <runningJobId>
// 3. ./bin/flink run -s hdfs:///flink/savepoints/savepoint-xxxx /path/to/new-job-v2.jar

10. Resource Governance Pattern

Goal: Ensure fair sharing and prevent interference between multiple jobs/tenants running on shared infrastructure.

Implementation Concepts:

Resource Isolation: Assigning dedicated resource quotas (CPU, memory, network).

Prioritization: Allowing higher-priority jobs to preempt or receive more resources.

APIs & Features: This pattern is primarily implemented at the cluster management / deployment layer, not directly within the stream processing framework's code APIs.

Flink:

Kubernetes: Use Namespaces, ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, Pod Priorities, Network Policies. Deploy Flink jobs with specific resource requests/limits in their Pod templates (via Flink K8s Operator or Session Job CRDs).

YARN: Use YARN Queues with capacity scheduling, node labels for pinning jobs to specific hardware. Submit Flink jobs to specific queues with priorities.

Kafka Streams: As standard applications, they rely entirely on the underlying orchestration (Kubernetes, Mesos, VMs) or container runtime for resource limits (e.g., Docker --cpus, --memory).

Spark SS: Relies on the cluster manager (YARN, Kubernetes, Mesos) features similar to Flink. Spark configuration (spark.cores.max, spark.executor.memory, etc.) sets requests.

# Kubernetes Example (ResourceQuota - Applied by Cluster Admin)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: streaming-team-quota
  namespace: streaming-apps
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "50"
    requests.memory: 200Gi
    limits.cpu: "100"
    limits.memory: 400Gi

# Flink on K8s Pod Template Snippet (Part of Deployment Spec)
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  taskManager:
    resource:
      memory: "4096m"
      cpu: 2.0
  jobManager:
     resource:
      memory: "2048m"
      cpu: 1.0
# ...

11. Isolated Dependency Pattern

Goal: Prevent dependency conflicts (JAR hell) between the user's job code and the stream processing framework or other jobs.

Implementation Concepts:

Shading: Repackaging dependencies within the job JAR, renaming their packages to avoid conflicts.

Classloader Isolation: Configuring the framework to prefer classes from the user JAR over its own (child-first) or vice-versa (parent-first).

APIs & Features:

Flink:

Shading: Use build tools like Maven Shade Plugin or Gradle Shadow JAR plugin to relocate conflicting dependencies (e.g., Guava, Jackson).

Classloading: Configure classloader.resolve-order: child-first (job JAR preferred) or parent-first (framework preferred, default) in flink-conf.yaml. child-first is often used to allow jobs to use different library versions than Flink itself.

Kafka Streams: Standard Java application. Relies heavily on shading using build tools (Maven Shade, Gradle Shadow) as it runs within a single JVM process with a flat classpath by default.

Spark SS: Shading is the most common approach. Spark also offers spark.driver.userClassPathFirst and spark.executor.userClassPathFirst configurations, similar to Flink's child-first.

12. Balanced Scaling Pattern

Goal: Ensure that scaling operations (increasing/decreasing parallelism) effectively distribute the workload, avoiding bottlenecks caused by data skew or uneven resource allocation.

Implementation Concepts:

Skew Detection: Monitor partition/task load distribution.

Rebalancing/Repartitioning: Redistribute data based on a different key or strategy if the current key causes skew.

Adaptive Scheduling: Framework automatically adjusts parallelism or task placement based on load (less common/mature).

APIs & Features:

Flink:

Monitoring: Checkpoint size/duration per subtask, Flink UI metrics (busyTimeMsPerSecond, records in/out per subtask). Custom metrics to track key distribution.

Rescaling: Change parallelism (setParallelism(N)) and restart from a savepoint.

Skew Mitigation:

Use .rebalance() before a skewed operator to distribute data round-robin (breaks key-based partitioning).

Implement two-stage aggregations: keyBy(skewedKey).map(addRandomPrefix).keyBy(prefixedKey).aggregate(...).keyBy(originalKey).aggregate(...).

Adaptive Scheduler: Experimental feature in newer Flink versions.

Kafka Streams:

Monitoring: Consumer lag per partition, processing rate per thread/task.

Repartitioning: Use stream.through("repartition-topic", Produced.with(...)) to write to an intermediate topic with more partitions or a different partitioning strategy before the skewed operation. Increase num.stream.threads.

Spark SS:

Monitoring: Task duration and shuffle read/write metrics in Spark UI.

Repartitioning: Use dataframe.repartition(N) or repartitionByRange. Salting keys (adding random prefix) is a common technique before grouping/joining.

// Flink Example (Rebalance before potentially skewed operator)
stream
    .keyBy(event -> event.getSkewedKey())
    // ... potentially some operations ...
    .rebalance() // Distribute data evenly before the next operator
    .map(new ExpensiveOperation()) // Assume this op doesn't need key context
    .setParallelism(32);

// Flink Example (Two-Stage Aggregation for Skew)
stream
    .keyBy(event -> event.getSkewedKey())
    .map(new MapFunction<Event, Tuple2<String, Event>>() { // Add random prefix to key
        @Override
        public Tuple2<String, Event> map(Event value) throws Exception {
            int salt = new java.util.Random().nextInt(10); // Example salt factor
            return Tuple2.of(value.getSkewedKey() + "#" + salt, value);
        }
    })
    .keyBy(tuple -> tuple.f0) // Key by salted key
    .reduce(new PartialAggregator()) // First stage aggregation
    .map(new MapFunction<Tuple2<String, Aggregation>, Tuple2<String, Aggregation>>() { // Remove salt
        @Override
        public Tuple2<String, Aggregation> map(Tuple2<String, Aggregation> value) throws Exception {
            String originalKey = value.f0.substring(0, value.f0.lastIndexOf('#'));
            return Tuple2.of(originalKey, value.f1);
        }
    })
    .keyBy(tuple -> tuple.f0) // Key by original key
    .reduce(new FinalAggregator()); // Second stage aggregation
