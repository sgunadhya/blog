title: "My Development Notes"
description: "My notes from developing software."

In my day job, I work with myriad technologies. This blog started as a place to jot down my technical notes.
Over time I started adding book reviews, and opinions on tech.

I like reading science fiction and historical fiction. In the ["Reviews"](/reviews) section, you can find reviews of some
well-known sci-fi.
